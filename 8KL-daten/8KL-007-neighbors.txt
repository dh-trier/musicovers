***
This script classifies album cover images by musical genre.
Here, this includes extracting the predicted labels for evaluation.
Output is a CSV file with test labels and the labels predicted for them.
Parameters:
Features tested: faces, objects, hsv values with 3 max values for H channel and max, std, median vor S and V channels
Size of test set: 100
classifier used: neighbors
***
Merge all Feature Data
***
Perform z-Score-Transformation on every channel of BGR color space including max and median
***
This script takes the preprocessed image data and extracts some features.
Input is a folder with image files. The images are colored.
Output is a CSV file with image features.
The features extracted here are indicator values from every feature extracted.
Color features are being extracted using OpenCV
***
Resize images to 500 x 500 pixels AND convert to RGB color space.
